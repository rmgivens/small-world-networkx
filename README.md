# small-world-networkx
Small-world network analysis using NetworkX

## Network

Network is a data structure for small-world person-to-group networks, for example: students and their links to courses. Networks can provide many small-world analysis metrics such as the largest component, the person-to-person and binary person-to-person network, and, for the latter networks, mean (unique) co-enrollments, number of unique edges, network density, average clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, network diameter, and k-step reach.

## Dependencies

Requires installation of [NetworkX](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).
